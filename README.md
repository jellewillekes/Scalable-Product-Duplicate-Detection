# Scalable Product Duplicate Detection

In this assignment we address the scalability issue for duplicate product detection using data coming from several Web shops. Due to the size of the data, as well as the number of comparisons to be performed, we propose a scalability solution for the involved computations by reducing the number of comparisons using the approximation technique of Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). The approach is evaluated for both efficacy and efficiency on an available real-world data set containing a large number of products.
